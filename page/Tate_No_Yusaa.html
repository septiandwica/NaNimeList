                                The Four Cardinal Heroes are a group of ordinary men from modern-day Japan
                                summoned to the kingdom of Melromarc to become its saviors. Melromarc is a
                                country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have repeatedly ravaged the
                                land and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are
                                respectively bestowed a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves.
                                Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku, becomes cursed with the fate of being the "Shield
                                Hero." Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled and ridiculed by
                                his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his weak offensive
                                capabilities and lackluster personality.
                                <br>
                                When the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi
                                sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, Malty Melromarc.
                                He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely accused of taking
                                advantage of her. Naofumi then becomes heavily discriminated against and hated
                                by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm of
                                hurt and mistrust in his heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening
                                himself and his reputation. Further along however, the difficulty of being on
                                his own sets in, so Naofumi buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named
                                Raphtalia to accompany him on his travels.
                                <br>
                                As the Waves approach the kingdom, Naofumi and Raphtalia must fight for the
                                survival of the kingdom and protect the people of Melromarc from their ill-fated
                                future.
